            <h2>Your baby is genius</a></h2> 
            <p>Man I thought that I was runing out of screen space so I gotta make this short and simple.</p>
            <p>And I didn't even knew how to make page scrollable or something like that.</p>
            <p>Then I thought why not I make multiple pages thing without making the page reload, simple yet cool</p>
            <p>Like simply hide and unhide stuffs when clicking those arrows down there</p>
            <p>Ain't I genius :)</p>
